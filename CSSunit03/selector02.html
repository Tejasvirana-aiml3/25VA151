        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language for creating and structuring web pages. It uses elements, defined by tags, to organize content like text, images, and links, providing the basic skeleton of a website that web browsers interpret to display a page. It is not a programming language, but a markup language that describes the structure and semantics of content, often combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
